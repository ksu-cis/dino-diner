# Menu Milestone 3

## Add Drink Classes + Unit Tests (100 points Possible)

DinoDiner currently offers four drinks:

* Sodasaurus (old-fashioned sodas)

* Tyrannotea (iced tea)

* JurrasicJava (coffee)

* Water (Water)

For each of these sides, you will need to create a corresponding C# class that inherits from a Drink abstract base class that you will also need to write.

## General Requirements

You will need to follow the provided style guide.

Each drink should be declared in the **DinoDiner.Menu.Drinks** namespace.


### Drink Base Class (10 points)
Implement an abstract base class to represent any drink.  It should contain properties for: **Price** (a double), **Calories** (an uint), **Ingredients** (a List&lt;string&gt;), **Size**  (using a Size enum, default small), and **Ice** (bool, default true). It should also implement a method **HoldIce()** which sets the **Ice** property to false.

### SodasaurusFlavor enum (10 points)
Implement an enum of flavors for the soda fountain.  Possible flavors are: Cola, Orange, Vanilla, Chocolate, RootBeer, Cherry, and Lime.

### Sodasaurus Class (10 points)
Implement a class to represent a Sodasaurus that inherits from the Drink class.  It should have an additional property of **Flavor** with type SodasaurusFlavor.  The price of a Sodasaurus is **$1.50** (small), **$2.00** (medium), and **$2.50** (large).  Calories are **112** (small), **156** (medium), and **208** (large). Its ingredients should be "Water", "Natural Flavors", and "Cane Sugar."

### Tyrannotea Class (10 points)
Implement a class to represent Tyrannotea that inherits from Drink.  It should have properties for **Sweet** (a bool, default false) and **Lemon** (a bool, default false).  Its price is **$0.99** (small), **$1.49** (medium), and **$1.99** (large).  Its calories are **8** (small), **16** (medium), and **32** (large).  Adding sweetener doubles these values.  It should also implement a method **AddLemon()** which sets the lemon to true.  Its ingredients should be "Water", "Tea", (if lemon was added) "Lemon", and (if sweet) "Cane Sugar".

### JurrasicJava Class (10 points)
Implement a class to represent the JurrasicJava, that inherits from the Drink class.  Unlike other drinks, it should default to **Ice** as false.  It should also implement properties for **RoomForCream** (bool, default false), **Decaf** (bool, default false).  It should also implement a method **LeaveRoomForCream()** and **AddIce()**. Its price is **$.59** (small), **$.99** (medium), and **$1.49** (large) and calories are **2** (small), **4** (medium), and **8** (large).  Its ingredients should be "Water" and "Coffee".

### Water Class (5 points)
Implement a class to represent a glass of water that inherits from the Drink base class.  It should have property **Lemon** (bool, default false), and a **AddLemon()** method.  The Water class should have a price of **$0.10** and **0** calories for all sizes.  Its ingredients should be "Water" and (if lemon was added) "Lemon".

### SodaSaurus Test Class (10 points)
Implement a test class that tests:
1. The ability to set each possible flavor
2. The correct default price, calories, ice, and size
3. The correct price and calories after changing to small, medium, and large sizes.
4. That invoking HoldIce() results in the Ice property being false.

### Tyrannotea Test Class (10 points)
Implement a test class that tests:
1. The correct default price, calories, ice, size, lemon, and sweet properties.
2. The correct price and calories after changing to small, medium, and large sizes.
3. That invoking HoldIce() results in the Ice property being false
4. That invoking AddLemon() sets results in the Lemon property being true.
5. That setting the sweet property to true results in the right calories for each size
6. That setting the sweet property to false (after it has been set to true) results in the right calories for each size.

### JurrasicJava test Class (10 points)
Implement a test class that tests:
1. The correct default price, calories, ice, size, and SpaceForCream properties.
2. The correct price and calories after changing to small, medium, and large sizes.
3. That invoking HoldIce() results in the Ice property being false
4. That invoking LeaveSpaceForCream() results in the SpaceForCream property being true.

### Water Test Class (5 points)
Implement a test class that tests:
1. The correct default price, calories, ice, size, and lemon properties.
2. The correct price and calories after changing to small, medium, and large sizes.
3. That invoking HoldIce() results in the Ice property being false
4. That invoking AddLemon() sets results in the Lemon property being true.
